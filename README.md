# Filllight
Fill Light is versatile lighting toolkit.
Fill Light transforms a phone into a powerful and highly customizable lighting tool, perfect for everything from daily tasks to creative projects. By leveraging both phone's LED flash and its screen, Fill Light offers a robust set of features in a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface.

Key Features

1. Powerful Dual-Light System

Go beyond a standard flashlight. Fill Light gives you complete control over your device's lighting capabilities:

Screen Mode: Turn your screen into a soft, colored fill light, perfect for subtle illumination, video calls, or mobile photography.

Flash Mode: Utilize your device's rear LED for a powerful, high-intensity beam of light.

Both Mode: Combine both the screen and the flash for maximum illumination when you need it most.

2. Advanced Screen Fill Light

The screen light isn't just a white screen. It's a creative tool:

Custom Colors: Choose from a palette of colors (White, Red, Yellow, Green, and more) to set the mood, create artistic effects, or use as a signaling device.

Softbox on the Go: Ideal for mobile photographers and videographers who need a soft, diffused light source to reduce harsh shadows.

3. Precise Control at Your Fingertips

Fill Light provides advanced controls typically found in professional equipment:

Timed Duration: Set a timer from 1 minute to 120 minutes for the light to automatically turn off, saving your battery. The "N/A" option allows for continuous operation.

Strobe/Blink Mode: Adjust the blinking frequency from a steady light (0 BPM) up to a rapid 140 Blinks Per Minute (BPM), perfect for parties, signaling, or technical uses.

Adjustable Strength: When the light is active, fine-tune the brightness with a simple strength level slider to get the exact amount of light you need.

4. One-Tap Emergency SOS Mode

Safety is paramount. The dedicated SOS button on the top bar provides quick access to a distress signal. For users who prefer a cleaner interface, this feature can be easily disabled in the settings.

5. Intuitive & Highly Customizable

Fill Light is designed for you to control:

Clean Interface: A large, central power button and a clear segmented control make operation effortless.

Save Last Status: Enable this option in settings to have the app remember your last used configuration (e.g., Flash mode, 30 BPM) for quick access.

Haptic Feedback: Enable satisfying physical feedback for major actions.

Appearance Settings: Configure the application's appearance to your liking.
